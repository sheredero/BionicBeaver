d-i debian-installer/fallbacklocale select fr_FR.UTF-8
d-i debian-installer/locale select fr_FR.UTF-8

# Disable automatic (interactive) keymap detection. 

d-i console-setup/ask_detect boolean false 

d-i keyboard-configuration/modelcode string pc105 

d-i keyboard-configuration/layoutcode string fr 

 

### Network configuration 

# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it 

# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface. 

d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto 

 

# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over 

# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions 

# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp. 

#d-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname 

#d-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain 

 

# Alternatively: by default, the installer uses CC.archive.ubuntu.com where 

# CC is the ISO-3166-2 code for the selected country. You can preseed this 

# so that it does so without asking. 

d-i mirror/http/mirror select fr.archive.ubuntu.com 

 

### Clock and time zone setup 

# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC. 

d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true 

 

# You may set this to any valid setting for $TZ; see the contents of 

# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for valid values. 

d-i time/zone string Europe/France 

 

# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install 

d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true 

 

# Alternatively, you may specify a disk to partition. If the system has only 

# one disk the installer will default to using that, but otherwise the device 

# name must be given in traditional, non-devfs format (so e.g. /dev/hda or 

# /dev/sda, and not e.g. /dev/discs/disc0/disc). 

# For example, to use the first SCSI/SATA hard disk: 

#d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda 

# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use. 

# The presently available methods are: 

# - regular: use the usual partition types for your architecture 

# - lvm:     use LVM to partition the disk 

# - crypto:  use LVM within an encrypted partition 

d-i partman-auto/method string regular

# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a 

# warning. This can be preseeded away...

# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions. 

d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true 

 

# For LVM partitioning, you can select how much of the volume group to use 

# for logical volumes.

# if no other operating system is detected on the machine. 

d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true 

 

# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other 

# OS, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS. 

d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true

#d-i grub-installer/bootdev  string (hd0,0)

#d-i debian-installer/add-kernel-opts string nousb 

 

### Finishing up the installation 

# During installations from serial console, the regular virtual consoles 

# (VT1-VT6) are normally disabled in /etc/inittab. Uncomment the next 

# line to prevent this. 

#d-i finish-install/keep-consoles boolean true 

 

# Avoid that last message about the install being complete. 

d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note 

 

# This will prevent the installer from ejecting the CD during the reboot, 

# which is useful in some situations. 

#d-i cdrom-detect/eject boolean false

#d-i debian-installer/exit/poweroff boolean true 

 

### X configuration 

# X can detect the right driver for some cards, but if you're preseeding, 

# you override whatever it chooses. Still, vesa will work most places. 

#xserver-xorg xserver-xorg/config/device/driver select vesa 

 

# A caveat with mouse autodetection is that if it fails, X will retry it 

# over and over. So if it's preseeded to be done, there is a possibility of 

# an infinite loop if the mouse is not autodetected. 

#xserver-xorg xserver-xorg/autodetect_mouse boolean true 

 

# Monitor autodetection is recommended. 

#xserver-xorg xserver-xorg/autodetect_monitor boolean true 

# Uncomment if you have an LCD display. 

#xserver-xorg xserver-xorg/config/monitor/lcd boolean true 

# X has three configuration paths for the monitor. Here's how to preseed 

# the "medium" path, which is always available. The "simple" path may not 

# be available, and the "advanced" path asks too many questions. 

#xserver-xorg xserver-xorg/config/monitor/selection-method \ 

#       select medium 

#xserver-xorg xserver-xorg/config/monitor/mode-list \ 

#       select 1024x768 @ 60 Hz 

 

### Preseeding other packages 

# Depending on what software you choose to install, or if things go wrong 

# during the installation process, it's possible that other questions may 

# be asked. You can preseed those too, of course. To get a list of every 

# possible question that could be asked during an install, do an 

# installation, and then run these commands: 

#   debconf-get-selections --installer > file 

#   debconf-get-selections >> file 

 

 

#### Advanced options 

### Running custom commands during the installation 

# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks 

# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a 

# preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from 

# trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful, 

# here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer, 

# automatically. 

 

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after 

# preseeding is read. 

#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb 

# This command is run immediately before the partitioner starts. It may be 

# useful to apply dynamic partitioner preseeding that depends on the state 

# of the disks (which may not be visible when preseed/early_command runs). 

#d-i partman/early_command \ 

#       string debconf-set partman-auto/disk "$(list-devices disk | head -n1)" 

# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is 

# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it 

# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install 

# packages and run commands in the target system.
